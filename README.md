# AWS Portfolio: Containerized React App Deployment

## üìå Project Overview

This project showcases a **production-ready React web application** deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker and Nginx. It demonstrates modern cloud deployment practices, containerization, and AWS infrastructure setup, making it a strong portfolio piece for DevOps and cloud engineering roles.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with Vite)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (EC2, Security Groups, IAM)
- **Web Server:** Nginx
- **Version Control:** GitHub

---

## üöÄ Features

- Production build of a React app using Vite
- Containerized with Docker and served via Nginx
- Deployed on AWS EC2 with secure port mapping and security group configuration
- Scalable architecture, ready for CI/CD integration
- Professional documentation, architecture diagram, and deployment demo

---

## ‚ö° Deployment Steps (High-Level)

1. **Create EC2 Instance**
   - Launch an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux/Ubuntu recommended)
   - Configure Security Groups to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) access

2. **Install Docker & Docker Compose**
   - SSH into your EC2 instance and install Docker:
     ```sh
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install docker.io -y
     sudo systemctl start docker
     sudo systemctl enable docker
     ```
   - (Optional) Install Docker Compose if needed

3. **Build and Run the Docker Image**
   - Clone your repository and navigate to the project directory
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```sh
     docker build -t react-app .
     ```
   - Run the container, mapping port 80:
     ```sh
     docker run -d -p 80:80 react-app
     ```

4. **Access the Application**
   - Visit your EC2 instance's public IP in a browser to view the deployed app

## üìö Extra Notes

- For production, consider using a domain name and HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
- Explore CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline for automated deployments
- Monitor and scale your EC2 instance as needed
